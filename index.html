          As Russia's military offensive in Ukraine continues, inflicting heavy

          This may be a conflict in the 21st century but, at times, with its
          maze of trenches, it feels more like something from the First World

          Russia's military offensive in eastern Ukraine is already
          intensifying. You can see it in the long queues of traffic driving
          west towards relative safety; you can feel it in the deserted streets
          as you drive through the towns and cities of the Donbas; and you can
          hear it with the increasing sound of Russian artillery.

          Russia is redeploying more of its forces from northern to eastern
          Ukraine. The objective is to step up the battle in the Luhansk and
          Donetsk - parts of which were already controlled by Russian backed
          separatists. Russia will take advantage of its shorter supply lines -
          something which proved a problem in its failed offensive on the
          capital Kyiv

          Ukraine has always seen an unstable environment since its formation or
          even before the Soviet Era. The protests and the shift of power
          followed by turmoils is one the common things found in Ukrainian
          history.

        <p class="scroll-p">
          During all the crises and protests in Ukriane the two main thoughts
          would come up among the public. First, that Ukraine should become a
          part of Europe and integrate with eastern side of the country. Second
          thought was to maintain friendly and close relationship with Russia
