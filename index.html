          As Russia's military offensive in Ukraine continues, inflicting heavy
          losses among both soldiers and civilians, these graphics show the
          latest developments, from military movements to companies withdrawing
          from Russia.

          This may be a conflict in the 21st century but, at times, with its
          maze of trenches, it feels more like something from the First World
          War.

          Russia's military offensive in eastern Ukraine is already
          intensifying. You can see it in the long queues of traffic driving
          west towards relative safety; you can feel it in the deserted streets
          as you drive through the towns and cities of the Donbas; and you can
          hear it with the increasing sound of Russian artillery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Russia is redeploying more of its forces from northern to eastern
          Ukraine. The objective is to step up the battle in the Luhansk and
          Donetsk - parts of which were already controlled by Russian backed
          separatists. Russia will take advantage of its shorter supply lines -
          something which proved a problem in its failed offensive on the
          capital Kyiv
