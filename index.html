          As Russia's military offensive in Ukraine continues, inflicting heavy
          losses among both soldiers and civilians, these graphics show the
          latest developments, from military movements to companies withdrawing
          from Russia.

        <p>
          This may be a conflict in the 21st century but, at times, with its
          maze of trenches, it feels more like something from the First World
          War.
        </p>
        <p>
          Russia's military offensive in eastern Ukraine is already
          intensifying. You can see it in the long queues of traffic driving
          west towards relative safety; you can feel it in the deserted streets
          as you drive through the towns and cities of the Donbas; and you can
          hear it with the increasing sound of Russian artillery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Russia is redeploying more of its forces from northern to eastern
          Ukraine. The objective is to step up the battle in the Luhansk and
          Donetsk - parts of which were already controlled by Russian backed
          separatists. Russia will take advantage of its shorter supply lines -
          something which proved a problem in its failed offensive on the
          capital Kyiv
